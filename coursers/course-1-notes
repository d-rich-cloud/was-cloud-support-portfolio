# Course 1 – Cloud Fundamentals (Notes)

These are my notes from the first course in the **Cloud Technology Consultant Professional Certificate**.

## Key Concepts I’ve Learned

- **What is Cloud Computing?**
  - On-demand access to computing resources (servers, storage, databases, networking) over the internet.
  - Key characteristics: on-demand, elastic, pay-as-you-go, managed by provider.

- **Service Models**
  - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** – virtual machines, storage, networks. Similar to AWS EC2, EBS, VPC.
  - **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** – managed platforms to run applications without managing servers.
  - **SaaS (Software as a Service)** – complete applications delivered over the internet (e.g., email, CRM).

- **Deployment Models**
  - Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, Multi-Cloud.

## How This Relates to AWS Support

- When customers have issues, they often don’t know or care whether it’s IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS—they just know “something in the cloud is broken.”
- As a support engineer, knowing the **model** helps me:
  - Understand what the customer controls vs. what AWS controls.
  - Guide troubleshooting more effectively.

## Sample Explanation (For Non-Technical Customers)

> The cloud is like renting a fully-managed office building instead of building your own. You pay for what you use, and the provider takes care of the electricity, security, and maintenance.

I’m practicing explaining these concepts in simple language because that’s important in support and consultant roles.
