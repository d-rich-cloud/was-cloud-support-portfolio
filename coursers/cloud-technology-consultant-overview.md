# Coursera: Cloud Technology Consultant Professional Certificate

This folder contains my notes, reflections, and mini-projects from the **Cloud Technology Consultant Professional Certificate** on Coursera.

## Program Goals (In My Own Words)

- Build a strong foundation in cloud concepts and terminology.
- Understand how cloud solutions are designed to meet business requirements.
- Develop the ability to communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Gain practical familiarity with cloud environments and support-style tasks.

## How This Ties Into AWS Cloud Support

While this is a consultant-focused program, many of the skills map directly to AWS Cloud Support and AMS roles:

- Explaining cloud concepts to customers → **Support communication skills**
- Understanding infrastructure components → **EC2, S3, VPC, IAM type services**
- Documenting solutions and processes → **Runbooks, KB articles, incident notes**
- Performing hands-on labs → **Replicates some daily tasks of support engineers**

## Structure of This Folder

As I complete the courses, I will add:

- `course-1-notes.md` – Core cloud concepts and terminology
- `course-2-notes.md` – Cloud architecture and services
- `course-3-notes.md` – Security, governance, and compliance basics
- `course-4-notes.md` – Hands-on labs and mini-projects
