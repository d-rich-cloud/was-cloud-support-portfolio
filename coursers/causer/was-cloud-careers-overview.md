# AWS Cloud Careers – Overview (From My Learning)

Based on the **Introduction to AWS Cloud Careers** course and other research, here is how I currently understand the main AWS-related roles and where I fit.

## Cloud Support / AMS (My Target)

**What they do:**
- Help customers diagnose and fix issues with their cloud environments.
- Answer tickets, troubleshoot incidents, and guide customers through configuration problems.
- Document solutions and create reusable knowledge (KB articles, runbooks).

**Skills required:**
- Strong fundamentals in cloud services (EC2, S3, IAM, networking).
- Good communication skills (explaining issues in simple terms).
- Patience and a methodical troubleshooting mindset.

**Why this fits me:**
- I enjoy problem-solving and helping others.
- I am comfortable documenting steps and following structured processes.
- I like the idea of working with existing systems and making them stable and reliable.

## Cloud Engineer / Architect

**What they do:**
- Design and build cloud environments and solutions.
- Work heavily with infrastructure as code, automation, and architectural patterns.
- Often more focused on _building_ than day-to-day support.

**Where I overlap:**
- Understanding of core services and best practices.
- Familiarity with incident patterns and common misconfigurations.

## DevOps / Site Reliability Engineer

**What they do:**
- Automate deployments, monitoring, and reliability systems.
- Build CI/CD pipelines and deep observability stacks.
- More coding/scripting-heavy roles.

**Where I overlap:**
- Interest in automation and scripting as I progress.
- Exposure to monitoring and alerting as part of support work.

## Cloud Consultant

**What they do:**
- Work with customers to understand business requirements.
- Recommend cloud solutions, migrations, and improvements.
- Mix of technical knowledge and communication/consulting skills.

**Where I overlap:**
- My Coursera **Cloud Technology Consultant** training.
- Ability to explain cloud concepts and options to non-technical people.

## My Current Direction

- **Short term goal:** Become effective in an AWS Cloud Support / AMS role.
- **Medium term goal:** Grow into roles that involve more automation and architecture decisions (e.g., Support Engineer → Cloud Engineer / Consultant).

This understanding shapes how I pick what to learn and what to document in this repository.
